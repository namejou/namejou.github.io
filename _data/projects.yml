  summary: >
    This project consists of an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze **student admission dynamics** using **public Parcoursup 2024 open data** (with mock data added for confidentiality).

    The dashboard was built for **program directors**, **academic decision-makers**, and **university leaders** to help:
      - Optimize recruitment and seat allocation during the admission campaign.
      - Track program attractiveness and admission rates.
      - Support data-driven planning for future admission cycles.

    The data model follows a **star-schema design**, connecting multiple relational tables (admissions, applications, offers, programs, and institutions) through unique identifiers.  
    Over **40 custom DAX measures** were developed to calculate official Parcoursup indicators — pressure rate, access rate, attractiveness, seat-filling ratio, last admitted rank, and complementary phase results — all **filterable by academic unit (faculty/UFR, IUT, or school)** and program.

    Each KPI includes an **information tooltip** explaining its definition and calculation method, ensuring clarity and transparency for decision-makers.

    This project demonstrates advanced skills in **data modeling, DAX optimization, and interactive storytelling**, applied to higher education analytics and decision support systems.

  summary: >
    In this academic project, we explored the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify traffic signs for autonomous driving systems. Using the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset, which contains more than 50,000 labeled images across 43 categories, our goal was to build a model capable of understanding real-world traffic scenarios with near-human precision.

    We started with a baseline CNN architecture using ReLU activation and progressively improved its performance through Batch Normalization, Dropout, and Global Average Pooling. Finally, by introducing the Swish activation function, the model achieved an outstanding 99.87% accuracy on the test set.

    Beyond simple classification, we designed a two-stage system:
      - A binary CNN to detect whether an image contains a traffic sign or not.
      - A multi-class CNN to identify the specific sign category.

    This hybrid approach enhances robustness in diverse environments and reduces false detections — a crucial step toward safer autonomous driving.

    Our work demonstrates how careful optimization of neural network architectures, combined with data augmentation and activation function tuning, can yield highly reliable models for computer vision applications in intelligent transportation systems.

  summary: >
    As part of our Master's program in Data Analytics at Sorbonne University, our team carried out a predictive modeling project focused on ranked matches in League of Legends. Using a dataset of over 190,000 matches from the highest competitive tiers (Master, GrandMaster, Challenger), we built machine learning models to identify which gameplay factors most strongly influence match outcomes.

    We applied XGBoost, optimized via GridSearch, to train separate models for each skill tier. After extensive data cleaning and feature selection, our models achieved over 97% accuracy. The analysis revealed that structural objectives (like towers and inhibitors) are the most reliable predictors of victory. We also found meaningful strategic differences between tiers and confirmed overall game balance between the red and blue teams.

    This project demonstrates our ability to design end-to-end predictive pipelines, conduct strategic data analysis, and draw actionable insights from large-scale competitive gaming data.
